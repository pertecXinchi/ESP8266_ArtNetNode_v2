In this section, we will briefly review some of the main topics covered in *A Textbook of Thermal Engineering* by RS Khurmi and JK Gupta.
  
- **Thermodynamics:** This is the branch of physics that deals with the relationship between heat, work, and energy. It also studies the properties and behavior of different types of systems, such as perfect gases, vapors, mixtures, and cycles. The book explains the basic concepts and laws of thermodynamics, such as temperature, pressure, volume, entropy, enthalpy, internal energy, heat capacity, and more. It also discusses various thermodynamic processes and cycles, such as isothermal, adiabatic, polytropic, Carnot, Otto, Diesel, Brayton, Rankine, and more.
- **Heat Transfer:** This is the branch of engineering that deals with the transfer of thermal energy from one body or system to another. It also studies the modes and mechanisms of heat transfer, such as conduction, convection, and radiation. The book explains the basic concepts and laws of heat transfer, such as Fourier's law, Newton's law of cooling, Stefan-Boltzmann law, Kirchhoff's law, and more. It also discusses various heat transfer problems and applications, such as heat conduction in solids, fins, heat exchangers, heat pipes, thermal insulation, and more.
- **Refrigeration and Air Conditioning:** This is the branch of engineering that deals with the production and maintenance of low temperatures and comfortable environments. It also studies the principles and components of refrigeration and air conditioning systems, such as refrigerants, compressors, condensers, evaporators, expansion devices, psychrometry, humidification, dehumidification, cooling load calculation, and more. The book explains the basic concepts and laws of refrigeration and air conditioning, such as refrigeration effect, coefficient of performance (COP), refrigeration cycle (vapor compression), air cycle (reverse Brayton), absorption cycle (vapor absorption), gas cycle (Stirling), and more.

These are just some of the topics covered in *A Textbook of Thermal Engineering* by RS Khurmi and JK Gupta. The book also covers other topics such as combustion of fuels (stoichiometry), steam boilers (classification), steam engines (indicator diagram), steam turbines (impulse and reaction), internal combustion engines (spark ignition and compression ignition), air compressors (reciprocating and rotary), gas turbines (open and closed cycle), and more. The book provides a comprehensive and systematic coverage of all aspects of thermal engineering that are relevant for mechanical engineering students.
