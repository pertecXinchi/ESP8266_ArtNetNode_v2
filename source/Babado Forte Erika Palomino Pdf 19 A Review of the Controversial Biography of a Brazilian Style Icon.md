The book covers topics such as the emergence of techno music, the influence of MTV, the rise of drag queens, the popularity of rave parties, the role of magazines and websites in spreading fashion news, the impact of globalization and digitalization on culture, and the diversity and creativity of Brazilian fashion. Palomino also shares her personal experiences and opinions as a journalist who witnessed and participated in many of these events.
 
Babado Forte is a Portuguese expression that means "strong gossip" or "big news", and it reflects Palomino's style of writing, which is informal, witty and provocative. The book is aimed at young readers who are interested in fashion, music and nightlife, but also at anyone who wants to learn more about the cultural changes that occurred in Brazil and in the world at the turn of the millennium.

One of the highlights of Babado Forte is the interview section, where Palomino talks to some of the most influential and innovative people in the fields of fashion, music and nightlife. Some of the interviewees are: Alexander McQueen, the British designer who revolutionized haute couture with his daring and dramatic creations; Madonna, the pop icon who constantly reinvented herself and set trends with her music and style; RuPaul, the American drag queen who became a global star and a symbol of empowerment and diversity; and Fernanda Young, the Brazilian writer and actress who created and starred in Os Normais, a comedy show that portrayed the life and relationships of a modern couple.
 
Another interesting feature of Babado Forte is the photo section, where Palomino showcases some of the most memorable and iconic images of fashion, music and nightlife from the late 1990s and early 2000s. The photos capture the essence and the atmosphere of that time, from the glamorous and extravagant runway shows of Paris and Milan, to the colorful and energetic rave parties in Brazil and Europe, to the intimate and candid portraits of celebrities and artists. The photos also reflect Palomino's personal taste and aesthetic, which is eclectic, bold and fun.
 
Babado Forte is a book that celebrates fashion, music and nightlife as forms of expression, communication and identity. It is also a book that documents a historical period that was marked by rapid changes, challenges and innovations in culture and society. Palomino invites the reader to join her in this journey through time and space, to discover, enjoy and learn from the stories and experiences of those who made history with their style and their attitude.
